  <article class="post-content">
    <p>There’s a somewhat breathless post entitled “The Death of Apache Drill” in a blog that has as a theme the imminent demise of technologies previously or currently associated with Hadoop, with the exception of the query engine formerly known as PrestoSQL, or Trino.  It’s ultimately a promotional piece for the website’s owner, which is entirely normal and usually it wouldn’t warrant further mention.  But it’s done whatever it is that it takes to climb up to the first page of the search results for “Apache Drill” so we’d like to share some thoughts of our own on a few of the points it makes.  I’ll have to leave you to search for it yourself since I don’t want to direct even more traffic to it by linking to it.</p>

<p>Firstly, the title proclaims a little too much.  Drill did suffer the loss of its primary corporate backer, and of course its pulse has been faint as a result, but we invite the author to visit the project and reconsider his declaration of death.   We don’t have hundreds of active contributors making thousands of commits a year but there are enough of us to get bugs fixed, new data sources supported, performance and reliability improved.  We’ve started talking about speeding up our release cadence to better reflect our recent activity.  We’re investing in increasing the project’s communication and improving and translating our documentation.  Metrics like downloads of Drill-related software suggest to us that interest has stopped trending down and started trending up.</p>

<p>Next, the notion that Drill is “tied”, locked in, to MapR and Hadoop.  As far as <em>Apache</em> Drill is concerned, this has never been true in the time I’ve worked on it .  You require nothing from MapR, nor do you need to run a single Hadoop service, in order to starting querying using the Drill binaries we distribute with default settings.  That is not to say that you <em>cannot</em> integrate Drill with MapR products and Hadoop, it supports these things well and its history is certainly intertwined with theirs, but you need never configure them e.g. if you’re using cloud object storage instead.  We do reuse some library code from Hadoop in our codebase, but so does Trino.</p>

<p>On performance and concurrency issues, I don’t have enough information to add anything useful to this.  I can say that we would treat fixing such issues as a priority if their magnitude was anything more than minor.  It’s worth noting that, While there are projects that focus on speed to the exclusion of all else, contemporary Drill places as much weight on flexibility as it does on speed.  The dichotomy implied by the post’s “Proprietary Solutions vs. Open Source” section heading?  It is a false one: Apache Drill is entirely open source and under permissive terms.</p>

<p>What of the need for users of Hadoop to be “fearful”?  Hadoop probably was overdeployed as many of us rushed to cargo cult another FAANG technology that was developed for a context that only some of us actually share.  But it’s a mature technology that solves a certain set of problems very well, it lives at Apache, and it is not about to vanish in a puff of smoke.  In my opinion there is no need for users of Hadoop to feel afraid, regardless of how their big data stacks might evolve in the future.  What about all the praise heaped on Trino?  I think that’s spot on.  It’s a very impressive project that has accomplished so much.  We’re impressed and we wish them all the best.</p>

<p>Drill is it a very interesting point in its history.  It presents a unique opportunity to developers who would like to challenge themselves in that individual contributions are not diluted in a sea of commits from others, and even newcomers can have a major impact.  If you’d like to come and pick an interesting problem in Drill to solve please feel welcomed, you’ll find us a friendly bunch.  If you’d like a job working full time on Drill then send an email to me at dzamo at apache.org.</p>
