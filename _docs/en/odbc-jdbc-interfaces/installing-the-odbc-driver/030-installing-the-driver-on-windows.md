The Drill ODBC Driver installer is available for 32- and 64-bit
applications on Windows. On 64-bit Windows operating systems, you can execute both 32- and 64-bit applications. However, 64-bit applications must use 64-bit drivers, and 32-bit applications must use 32-bit drivers. Make sure that you use the driver version that matches the bitness of the client application machine.
					
  * Drill 1.3 32-bit.msi for 32-bit applications
  * Drill 1.3 64-bit.msi for 64-bit applications


{% include startnote.html %}Currently Drill does not support a 32-bit Windows machine. However, the 32- or 64-bit Drill ODBC Driver is supported on a 64-bit machine.{% include endnote.html %}


To install the Drill ODBC Driver on a system that meets the system requirements, complete the following steps:

   *  [Step 1: Download the Drill ODBC Driver]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installing-the-driver-on-windows/#step-1:-download-the-drill-odbc-driver)
   *  [Step 2: Install the Drill ODBC Driver]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installing-the-driver-on-windows/#step-2:-install-the-drill-odbc-driver)
   *  [Step 3: Verify the Installation]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installing-the-driver-on-windows/#step-3:-verify-the-installation)

##  System Requirements

Each computer where you install the driver must meet the following system
requirements:

  * One of the following operating systems are supported:
    * Windows Vista, 7, 8, or 10
    * Windows Server 2008 or later
  * 75 MB of available disk space
  * .NET Framework 4.5, installed and enabled by default on Windows 8 and later
  * [Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2013](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784) installed (with the same bitness as the driver that you are installing)

  * The client must be able to resolve the actual host name of the Drill node or nodes from the IP address. Verify that a DNS entry was created on the client machine for the Drill node or nodes. If not, create an entry in `\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts` for each node in the following format:

    `<drill-machine-IP> <drill-machine-hostname>`

	Example:

	`127.0.0.1 localhost`

To install the driver, you need Administrator privileges on the computer.

## Step 1: Download the Drill ODBC Driver

{% include startnote.html %}
Post the acquisition of MapR by HPE, the MapR ODBC driver's licensing and distribution have changed.
{% include endnote.html %}

The latest advice shared with the open source project by HPE follows.

> You must create a HPE passport account with your email, then you must obtain a token: [https://docs.ezmeral.hpe.com/datafabric-customer-managed/75/AdvancedInstallation/Obtaining_a_Token.html](https://docs.ezmeral.hpe.com/datafabric-customer-managed/75/AdvancedInstallation/Obtaining_a_Token.html). With your token and your passport email then you can connect to [https://package.ezmeral.hpe.com/tools/MapR-ODBC/MapR_Drill/MapRDrill_odbc_v1.5.1.1002/](https://package.ezmeral.hpe.com/tools/MapR-ODBC/MapR_Drill/MapRDrill_odbc_v1.5.1.1002/).

## Step 2: Install the Drill ODBC Driver

1. Double-click the installer from the location where you downloaded it.
2. Click **Next.**
3. Select the check box to accept the terms of the License Agreement and click **Next**.
4. Verify or change the install location. Then, click **Next**.

----------

## Step 3: Verify the Installation

To verify the installation on Windows 10, perform the following steps:

1\. Go to **Settings** and enter **odbc**.


2\. Select **Set up ODBC data sources `<version>`**.  The **ODBC Data Source Administrator `<version>`** dialog appears. Click the **System DSN** to view the Drill data source.
