First, check that you [meet the prerequisites]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/embedded-mode-prerequisites), and then install Apache Drill on Linux or Mac OS X:

Complete the following steps to install Drill:

1. In a terminal window, change to the directory where you want to install Drill.
2. [Download the latest version of Apache Drill](https://drill.apache.org/download/)
3. Copy the downloaded file to the directory where you want to install Drill.
4. Extract the contents of the Drill `.tar.gz` file. Use sudo only if necessary:
`tar -xvzf <.tar.gz file name>`

The extraction process creates the installation directory containing the Drill software. You can now [start Drill]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/starting-drill-on-linux-and-mac-os-x).
